                    <p className={styles.p}>I started programming in middle school in Scratch and became very interested in building applications for people. Some of my accomplishments currently include building full-stack applications for the Digital Learning team at the Paul Merage School of Business at UCI and almost winning a hackathon (jk we lost). One of my favorite lines to say is "it's all mental" in every challenge I come to face with which means nothing is impossible to beat! Feel free to contact me at deveshkrishan2003@gmail.com.</p>
                    <p className={styles.p}>Some of my free time is spent playing video games with friends, watching movies, and sleeping! </p>
