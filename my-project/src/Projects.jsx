Engineered an interactive U.S. map with color-coded indicators for poverty rates, enabling users to focus on individual states for detailed analysis through line graphs. This feature covers poverty rate trends, annual income statistics, and population figures in poverty. Implemented year-wise filtering and multi-data view capabilities, including comprehensive income data visualization and executed real-time data retrieval from the U.S. Census Bureau API, coupled with an efficient Python-based optimization of a 72,000-line CSV Time Series dataset. Ensured instantaneous loading of all graphical data representations." , image: pv_image,key: 0},

Engineered a relational database using Microsoft Azure SQL, guided by ER diagrams, to efficiently manage user and movie data. Crafted SQL queries to streamline backend data retrieval. Ensured robust application performance through comprehensive Python unit testing. Prioritized user privacy byimplementing encryption for user data and integrating secure authentication protocols. Adopted Agile practices to optimize team collaboration and project management, resulting in a 20% acceleration in project delivery.", image: cs_image, key: 1},
